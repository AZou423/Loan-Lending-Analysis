# Loan-Lending-Analysis of LendingClub

## Project Overview

LendingClub is a digital marketplace bank that offers various loans, like personal and small business loans, auto refinancing, etc. It began as a peer-to-peer lending company in 2007, but transitioned to a fully chartered bank in 2021 after acquiring Radius Bank. In this project, I analyze a dataset of their loans from 2007 to 2018 to identify trends in loan volume, borrower behavior, loan performance, and risk patterns over time. The ultimate goal of this project was to harness these insights to drive strategic decisions about scaling high-performing loan categories while reducing exposure to high-risk borrower segments for the growth and strategy team.
